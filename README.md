# Overview

This is a minimalistic CLI tool to download songs from YouTube. I built this to be used for car songs, hence the name
`vtunes` - vehicle tunes. The module includes translations for several languages

# Installation & Usage

> The required Python version for this is 3.9+
> 
> You **must** have FFMPEG installed in order for this to work.

```
git clone https://github.com/novusys/vtunes
cd vtunes
py -m pip install requirements.txt -r
py main.py
```

and voilla! That's it, follow the messages in terminal for help with usage.
